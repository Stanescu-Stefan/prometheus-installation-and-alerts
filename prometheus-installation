

wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.45.1/prometheus-2.45.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar xvf prometheus-2.45.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

cd prometheus-2.45.1.linux-amd64/


ls -al
you will see several files. the most important ones are

prometheus file is the application executable

prometheuus.yml is the config file

promtool is a command-line utility


to check if prometheus can start with issues, run ./prometheus

we can go and check http://localhost:9090/ on your local machine to see the Prometheus expression browser.

You can type up, you should see 1 target in an up state, prometheus itself


up{instance=""locahost:9090", job="prometheus"}                    1

When we start Prometheus by running ./prometheus, it will start running in the foreground and also it will not start on boot.

so we need to configure it as a Systemd service unit so we could do systemctl start prometheus


first we need to create a prometheus user.
